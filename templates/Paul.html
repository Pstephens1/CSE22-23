<p text-align= center> This link takes you to a weight tracking program I made with John Nelson to assist in weight tracking for weight lifters, created during our second unit of term four this year. The purpose of this code is to grant athletes that like to lift a lot an easy way to log and calculate the amount of weight they need for each lift.<p>

<p text-align= center> This image shows the code used for the SDV's in our first unit of term four, that told the robots to create a convoy by using the vision sensor to detect where the lead robot was and whether it should go forward, stop, or turn left and right to remain directly behind the leader. <p>
